                 databases are critical resources for widespread applications
                 including marker-gene and metagenome sequencing for microbiome
                 analysis, diet metabarcoding, and environmental DNA (eDNA)
                 surveys. Reproducibly generating, managing, using, and
                 evaluating nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference
                 databases creates a significant bottleneck for researchers
                 aiming to generate custom sequence databases. Furthermore,
                 database composition drastically influences results, and lack
                 of standardizations limits cross-study comparisons. To address
                 these challenges, we developed RESCRIPt, a software package
                 for reproducible generation and management of reference
                 sequence taxonomy databases, including dedicated functions
                 that streamline creating databases from popular sources, and
                 functions for evaluating, comparing, and interactively
                 exploring qualitative and quantitative characteristics across
                 reference databases.ResultsTo highlight the breadth and
                 capabilities of RESCRIPt, we provide several examples for
                 working with popular databases for microbiome profiling
                 (SILVA, Greengenes, NCBI-RefSeq, GTDB), eDNA, and diet
                 metabarcoding surveys (BOLD, GenBank), as well as for genome
                 comparison. We show that bigger is not always better, and
                 reference databases with standardized taxonomies and those
                 that focus on type strains have quantitative advantages,
                 though may not be appropriate for all use cases. Most
                 databases appear to benefit from some curation (quality
                 filtering), though sequence clustering appears detrimental to
                 database quality. Finally, we demonstrate the breadth and
                 extensibility of RESCRIPt for reproducible workflows with a
                 comparison of global hepatitis genomes.ConclusionsRESCRIPt
                 provides tools to democratize the process of reference
                 database acquisition and management, enabling researchers to
                 reproducibly and transparently create reference materials for
                 diverse research applications. RESCRIPt is released under a

               assume that all species in the reference database are equally
               likely to be observed. We demonstrate that classification
               accuracy degrades linearly with the degree to which that
               assumption is violated, and in practice it is always violated.
               By incorporating environment-specific taxonomic abundance
               information, we demonstrate a significant increase in the
               species-level classification accuracy across common sample
               types. At the species level, overall average error rates decline
               from 25\% to 14\%, which is favourably comparable to the error
               rates that existing classifiers achieve at the genus level
               (16\%). Our findings indicate that for most practical purposes,
               the assumption that reference species are equally likely to be
               observed is untenable. q2-clawback provides a straightforward
               alternative for samples from common environments.",
