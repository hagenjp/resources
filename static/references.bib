GTDB R06-RS202 spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270\\% increase since the introduction of the GTDB in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200\\% increase since the integration of species clusters into the GTDB in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.}",

  abstract  = {The accrual of genomic data from both cultured and uncultured microorganisms provides new opportunities to develop systematic taxonomies based on evolutionary relationships. Previously, we established a bacterial taxonomy through the Genome Taxonomy Database. Here, we propose a standardized archaeal taxonomy that is derived from a 122-concatenated-protein phylogeny that resolves polyphyletic groups and normalizes ranks based on relative evolutionary divergence. The resulting archaeal taxonomy, which forms part of the Genome Taxonomy Database, is stable for a range of phylogenetic variables including marker gene selection, inference methods, corrections for rate heterogeneity and compositional bias, tree rooting scenarios and expansion of the genome database. Rank normalization is shown to robustly correct for substitution rates varying up to 30-fold using simulated datasets. Taxonomic curation follows the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes while taking into account proposals to formally recognize the rank of phylum and to use genome sequences as type material. This taxonomy is based on 2,392 archaeal genomes, 93.3{\%} of which required one or more changes to their existing taxonomy, mainly owing to incomplete classification. We identify 16 archaeal phyla and reclassify 3 major monophyletic units from the former Euryarchaeota and one phylum that unites the Thaumarchaeota--Aigarchaeota--Crenarchaeota--Korarchaeota (TACK) superphylum into a single phylum.},

However, almost 40{\%} of the genomes in the Genome Taxonomy Database lack a species name. We address this limitation by using commonly accepted average nucleotide identity criteria to set bounds on species and propose species clusters that encompass all publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomes. Unlike previous average nucleotide identity studies, we chose a single representative genome to serve as the effective nomenclatural `type' defining each species. Of the 24,706 proposed species clusters, 8,792 are based on published names. We assigned placeholder names to the remaining 15,914 species clusters to provide names to the growing number of genomes from uncultivated species. This resource provides a complete domain-to-species taxonomic framework for bacterial and archaeal genomes, which will facilitate research on uncultivated species and improve communication of scientific results.},

                 databases are critical resources for widespread applications
                 including marker-gene and metagenome sequencing for microbiome
                 analysis, diet metabarcoding, and environmental DNA (eDNA)
                 surveys. Reproducibly generating, managing, using, and
                 evaluating nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference
                 databases creates a significant bottleneck for researchers
                 aiming to generate custom sequence databases. Furthermore,
                 database composition drastically influences results, and lack
                 of standardizations limits cross-study comparisons. To address
                 these challenges, we developed RESCRIPt, a software package
                 for reproducible generation and management of reference
                 sequence taxonomy databases, including dedicated functions
                 that streamline creating databases from popular sources, and
                 functions for evaluating, comparing, and interactively
                 exploring qualitative and quantitative characteristics across
                 reference databases.ResultsTo highlight the breadth and
                 capabilities of RESCRIPt, we provide several examples for
                 working with popular databases for microbiome profiling
                 (SILVA, Greengenes, NCBI-RefSeq, GTDB), eDNA, and diet
                 metabarcoding surveys (BOLD, GenBank), as well as for genome
                 comparison. We show that bigger is not always better, and
                 reference databases with standardized taxonomies and those
                 that focus on type strains have quantitative advantages,
                 though may not be appropriate for all use cases. Most
                 databases appear to benefit from some curation (quality
                 filtering), though sequence clustering appears detrimental to
                 database quality. Finally, we demonstrate the breadth and
                 extensibility of RESCRIPt for reproducible workflows with a
                 comparison of global hepatitis genomes.ConclusionsRESCRIPt
                 provides tools to democratize the process of reference
                 database acquisition and management, enabling researchers to

               By incorporating environment-specific taxonomic abundance
